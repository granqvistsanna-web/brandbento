## Problem

Only PNG export is currently supported. Designers often need vector formats (SVG, PDF) for print or scalable assets.

## Solution

- SVG export option alongside PNG
- PDF export option
- Copy-to-clipboard for exported images
- TBD: approach for SVG (html-to-svg library?) and PDF (jsPDF or similar)
