# Tile Review & Refinement

**Priority:** High
**Type:** Quality pass

## Goal
Review every tile for design quality, edit options, flexibility, naming, content, and variations. Each tile is reviewed one at a time with user sign-off before moving to the next.

## Review Checklist (per tile)
1. **Design** — Studio quality? Typography hierarchy, whitespace, surface treatment
2. **Edit options** — Floating toolbar: what's exposed, anything missing or unnecessary?
3. **Flexibility** — Shape adaptive (landscape/portrait/square), font clamping, proportional spacing
4. **Naming** — Does the tile type name make sense for designers?
5. **Content** — Are defaults aspirational? Real copy, not placeholder text
6. **Variations** — Distinct enough? Any gaps?
