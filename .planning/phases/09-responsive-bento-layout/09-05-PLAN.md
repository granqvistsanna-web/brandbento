  <what-built>
Complete responsive bento layout system with:
1. BentoGrid component with 100dvh viewport fitting
2. BentoTile wrapper with responsive spans
3. 4 layout presets (balanced, heroLeft, heroCenter, stacked)
4. Density modes (cozy/dense)
5. Debug overlay for development
6. Layout controls in ControlPanel
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
**Start dev server:** `npm run dev`

**Test 1: Viewport Height Constraint (Success Criteria #2)**
1. Open browser at localhost
2. Verify no vertical scrollbar appears
3. Grid fills exactly the viewport height
4. Resize window height - grid adapts, never scrolls

**Test 2: Filled Rectangle (Success Criteria #1)**
1. With debug mode ON, verify all grid cells are covered by tiles
2. No empty gaps inside the grid bounding box
3. Check at each breakpoint (resize browser):
   - Desktop (>1024px)
   - Tablet (768-1023px)
   - Mobile (<768px)

**Test 3: Layout Presets (Success Criteria #3)**
1. Use preset selector in ControlPanel
2. Test each preset: balanced, heroLeft, heroCenter, stacked
3. Verify layout changes without breaking
4. Tiles should rearrange smoothly

**Test 4: Responsive Breakpoints (Success Criteria #4)**
1. Slowly resize browser from desktop to mobile
2. Verify NO janky rearrangement on minor width changes
3. Layout should only change at breakpoint boundaries (768px, 1024px)
4. Tiles maintain visual hierarchy

**Test 5: No Overflow or Overlap (Success Criteria #5)**
1. Enable debug mode
2. Verify tile borders don't extend beyond their grid cells
3. No tile overlaps another tile
4. Text content doesn't overflow tile boundaries

**Test 6: Density Modes (Success Criteria #7)**
1. Toggle between Cozy and Dense in ControlPanel
2. Cozy: larger gaps (16px), taller rows (280px)
3. Dense: smaller gaps (8px), shorter rows (200px)
4. Grid remains properly fitted

**Test 7: Debug Mode (Success Criteria #9)**
1. Toggle debug mode ON
2. Pink dashed grid appears showing all cells
3. Each cell numbered with column/row info
4. Info panel shows: preset, breakpoint, grid size, density
5. Toggle OFF - overlay disappears

**Test 8: Mobile Safe Areas (Success Criteria #8)**
1. Open in Chrome DevTools device mode
2. Select iPhone X or device with notch
3. Enable safe area inset simulation
4. Verify grid respects bottom safe area

**Test 9: Graceful Degradation (Success Criteria #6)**
1. Temporarily add extra tiles beyond grid capacity
2. Verify tiles that don't fit are hidden (not breaking layout)
3. Enable debug mode - should show hidden tile count
4. Large tiles on mobile should reduce spans automatically

**Test 10: Variable Tile Count (Success Criteria #10)**
1. Test with minimum tiles (6 tiles) - layout should work
2. Test with maximum tiles (14 tiles) - extra tiles hidden gracefully
3. Standard 9-tile configuration works as expected

All 10 Phase 9 success criteria must be verified:

1. [x] Bento grid always forms a filled rectangle (no empty cells inside the bounding box) at every breakpoint
2. [x] Grid fits within 100dvh/100vh with no vertical scrolling
3. [x] Supports 3-5 layout presets (balanced, hero-left, hero-center, stacked, etc.)
4. [x] Deterministic and stable layout - no janky rearrangement on minor width changes
5. [x] Tiles never overflow the grid or overlap
6. [x] Graceful degradation when tiles can't fit (span reduction or priority-based hiding)
7. [x] Density parameter works correctly (cozy vs dense modes)
8. [x] Mobile safe areas respected with proper padding
9. [x] Debug mode available showing grid cell boundaries and tile IDs
10. [x] Works with 6-14 tiles within the defined min/max range

All criteria now have implementation coverage including graceful degradation (Plan 06).
