  <what-built>Complete workflow features: keyboard shortcuts, export, share, reset, read-only view</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
Test each feature systematically:

**1. Keyboard Shortcuts (TOOL-04)**
- [ ] Make a change (e.g., click a color swatch, change palette)
- [ ] Press Cmd+Z - change should undo
- [ ] Press Cmd+Shift+Z - change should redo
- [ ] Verify browser undo doesn't conflict

**2. Undo/Redo Buttons**
- [ ] Undo button is disabled when nothing to undo
- [ ] Make changes, verify Undo button enables
- [ ] Undo works via button click
- [ ] Redo button works after undo

**3. Export PNG (EXPRT-01 through EXPRT-04)**
- [ ] Click Export button - PNG downloads
- [ ] Open PNG - only bento canvas visible (no toolbar/footer)
- [ ] If on Retina display, image is high quality

**4. Share Link (SHAR-01, SHAR-02)**
- [ ] Click Share button
- [ ] "Copied!" toast appears
- [ ] Paste URL - verify it has #compressed_state and ?view=readonly

**5. Read-Only View (SHAR-03)**
- [ ] Open the shared URL in new tab
- [ ] Verify banner shows "View-only mode"
- [ ] Verify toolbar/control panel are hidden
- [ ] Click tiles - nothing should happen
- [ ] Click "Create your own" - should go to editable version

**6. Reset (TOOL-07, TOOL-08)**
- [ ] Click Reset button
- [ ] Confirmation dialog appears
- [ ] Cancel - nothing changes
- [ ] Confirm - moodboard resets to new template
- [ ] Toast shows "Moodboard reset!"
- [ ] Press Cmd+Z - previous state is restored (reset is undoable)
